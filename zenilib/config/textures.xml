<!-- Images to load into the Textures Database in Zenilib

For each entry in Textures:

  1. 'token' should match the name you want to use in C++
  2. 'filepath' should be the path from within 'zenilib/'
  3. 'tile' should be 0 for best quality if tiling is unnecessary
     'tile' should be 1 to enable tiling
     
     If 'tile' is 1 and tiling is not desired, floating point
     error can make things look worse at the edges of tiles.

The following formats are supported:

  1. PNG is supported with 8 bits per channel.
  2. BMP is fully supported AFAIK.
  3. TIFF is supported with 8 bits per channel.
     TIFF supports deflate and JPEG compression.

The following things are unsupported:

  1. JPEG and GIF images
  2. Indexed color
  3. Indexed transparency
  4. Anything other than 8 bits per channel
